                    Emily is a kind, intelligent, beautiful little girl.<br>
                    She is my first child and changed my life in many ways.<br>
                    Her energy and precociousness brings <em>a lot</em> of <br>
                    excitement to the family.

                    <strong>Conor is an empathetic soul.</strong> He regards others feelings in a<br>
                    way I've never seen in a toddler. He's strong-willed, funny,<br>
                    and he knows all to well how cute he is. He completed our family.
